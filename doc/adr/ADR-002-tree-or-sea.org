#+TITLE: ADR-003: Sea or Tree of Nodes?

* Status

Accepted.

* Context

We need to find a representation for the intermediate representation
(IR) nodes.

* Possible Solutions

** Tree of Nodes

The classical representation is a tree of nodes, which represents the
nesting of the nodes.

Advantages:
- Simple

** Sea of Nodes

scala-lms uses a sea of nodes, which is quite handy for deeper
optimizations, e.g. code deduplication/motion.

Advantages:
- allows for deeper optimizations.

Disadvantages:
- Complex to implement.
- Not sure how much work it would be to get a self-hosting language.

* Decision

We implement *Tree of Nodes*. Afterwards we might still experiment
with a Sea of Nodes.
